# About Section Mobile Fix - June 10, 2025

## Issue Fixed
- User reported a redundant empty pink container button appearing above "The Artist" section on mobile view
- The issue was likely caused by malformed HTML or CSS rendering issues on mobile devices

## Solution Applied
1. Created `about-mobile-cleanup.css` to:
   - Hide any empty glass-pill elements
   - Remove orphaned span elements without proper classes
   - Clean up any duplicate section badges
   - Fix spacing issues in the about section header on mobile
   
2. Added the CSS file to the HTML head section after `about-mobile-tabs-fix.css`

## Files Modified
- `/docs/styles/about-mobile-cleanup.css` - New CSS file created
- `/docs/index.html` - Added link to new CSS file

## Backup Created
- Full backup saved in `backups/good-backup-state-20250610/` before making changes

This fix ensures a cleaner mobile experience by removing any redundant UI elements that might appear due to responsive layout issues.
